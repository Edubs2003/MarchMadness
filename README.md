Ethan Waggoner, Mike Gladdon, and Liam Matney, three students at the University of Chicago, created multiple machine learning algorithms using historical March Madness data. Specifically, we focused on predicting first-round matchup success better than Seed (the higher seed winning) and ESPN's in-house Prediction Algorithm. In this GitHub repository, you can find a paper summarizing our results and journey, as well as the code and data we used to create the algorithms themselves.
